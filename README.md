# Dairy Management System

This repository contains two projects for a Dairy Management System - an Angular frontend (dairy-ng) and a Nest.js backend (dairy-ns). These projects work together to provide a comprehensive solution for managing dairy-related data.

## dairy-ng (Angular Frontend)

### Overview

The "dairy-ng" folder contains the Angular frontend for the Dairy Management System. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the dairy data and performs various client-side operations.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the "dairy-ng" folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Use `ng serve` to start the development server.
4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

### Features

- User authentication and authorization.
- Dashboard for an overview of dairy data.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for dairy records.
- Data visualization for dairy statistics.

### Technologies Used

- Angular
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap (or any other styling framework)
- Angular Router for routing
- NgRx for state management (optional)

## dairy-ns (Nest.js Backend)

### Overview

The "dairy-ns" folder contains the Nest.js backend for the Dairy Management System. It handles data storage, retrieval, and business logic. The backend serves as an API for the frontend.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the "dairy-ns" folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Configure your database connection in the `config` folder.
4. Use `npm run start:dev` to start the development server.

### Features

- RESTful API for managing dairy data.
- Data validation and error handling.
- Authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).

### Technologies Used

- Nest.js
- TypeScript
- TypeORM (or any other database ORM/ODM)
